* Open terminal
* Check your directory (pwd)
* If you’ve never installed **create-react-app** before, you can simply run this command:

```
npx create-react-app myfirstreactapp
```

* create-react-app folderName (_a folder in that name will be created at this point)_
* If you have _Yarn_ installed, **create-react-app** will use it by default to create new projects. If you would prefer to use npm, you can append **\--use-npm** to the creation command. It will look like this:

```
npx create-react-app myfirstreactapp --use-npm
```

* At any point in time, (Feel free to replace **myfirstreactapp** with whatever name you want, as long as it doesn’t contain capital letters :-))

**If you leave and return**

* Open terminal
* check directory (pwd)
* cd  yourfolderName
* npm start _(this will start the application_)
